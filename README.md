# SOETools
Sequence-of-Event (SOE) Tools are collection of specially built display screens for an extended version of openXDA that can be used by 
distribution companies to study the operation of automated sectionalized switches.  Developed with funding from EPRI and EPB Chattanooga, 
these tools leverage EPB's fiber network to capture event data from their pole-mounted switches so that it can be quickly parsed and processed by openXDA.
